**Note: These are just simple concepts that we will teach through pesudo code**

## Which programming language we will choose?

I'll recommend these three languages for practices of above concepts in multiple syntax.

- Python (because of its simplicity)
- Php
- C++

**This should be covered in two weeks**

## What is object oriented programming and why we use it.

- Class
- Objects
- Constructor
- Destrcutor
- Methods

- Abstract
- Polymorphism
- Encapsulation
- Static method and properties

My recommendation of a programming language will be php or c++

**This should be covered in one week**

## Data structures

Types of data structures

- Linear data structure
  - Array Data Structure
  - Stack Data Structure
  - Queue Data Structure
  - Linked List Data Structure
